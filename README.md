Welcome to Battleship in C++!

I replicated the popular game using object-oriented programming with player vs. player and player vs. computer modes. The program is orientated on a 10 x 10 sized grid, keeps track of turns, notifies user for each hit or miss, and relies on an AI-based algorithm for the computerâ€™s turns to target the most common ship spots based on past game data and reading in whether the current move was a hit or miss to optimize the best decision on the next turn.
